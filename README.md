## 👋 Hi there, I'm Patryk Mroczek!

🎯 Future **Security Engineer** | 🧠 Project-Based Learner

I'm currently working as an IT Security Officer and actively transitioning into a **Security Engineer** or **devsecops** role by building hands-on projects focused on system hardening, enterprise network design, and automation.

I believe that strong security starts with understanding the basics: how systems work, where they break, and how to defend them — manually first, then with automation.

### 🛠 My Projects

#### 🔐 [Linux CIS Hardening Lab (Rocky Linux 9)](https://github.com/RoadBlack/linux-cis-hardening-ansible)
Hands-on lab to manually and automatically harden a Rocky Linux 9 system using the **CIS Benchmarks**.

- ✅ Manual CIS hardening with documentation
- ✅ OpenSCAP scanning and remediation
- ⚙️ Ongoing automation with Ansible (SSH, PAM, system roles)
- 📚 Learnings: Linux security foundations, CIS controls, why manual steps matter before automation

#### 🧠 [Enterprise Network Security Design](https://github.com/RoadBlack/NetworkProjects)
A simulated mid-sized enterprise network project with focus on **segmentation**, **firewalling**, and **redundancy**:

- 🔒 Secure network architecture for medium-sized business
- 🔁 HAProxy, VLANs, pfSense-based firewalls
- 🧩 Clear visual topology + configuration backups
- 🛡️ Focused on real-world security practices in routing, switching, and isolation

### 🧭 Road to Security Engineering

In 2025, I’m focusing on:

- 📚 Mastering **Linux security**, **network design**, and **automation**
- 🧪 Building labs to learn **incident response**, **SIEM**, and **detection engineering**
- ☁️ Adding cloud (AWS) + container security (Docker/K8s) to my toolbelt
- 👨‍💻 Sharing my work here to stay accountable and help others learn
